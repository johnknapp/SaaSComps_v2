# Description

## Understanding the impact of growth rates and Gross margin on B2B SaaS valuations

**Summary**
    
For high growth B2B SaaS, ***revenue growth*** (*not profitability*) ***drives valuation***

* *Valuation multiples* are well explained by *revenue growth* 
    * Model fit is good (High R^2)
    * Revenue growth is a statistically significant factor (low p-value)
    * *Gross Margin* does not influence *valuation multiples*
        * Poor relationship between Revenue multiples and Gross margin (high p-value)

For the rest of B2B SaaS (i.e non high growth SaaS), the picture is less clear

* *Revenue growth* by itself doesn't adequately explain *valuation multiples* 
    * * Model fit is poor (low R^2)
    * But *Revenue growth* is still a statistically significant factor (low p-value)
    * *Gross Margin* does not influence *valuation multiples*
        * Poor relationship between Revenue multiples and Gross margin (high p-value)
